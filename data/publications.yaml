  - title: "'Impressively Scary': Exploring User Perceptions and Reactions to Unraveling Machine Learning Models in Social Media Applications"
    authors: [ "Jack West", "Bengisu Cagiltay", "Shirley Zhang",  "Jingjie Li",  "Kassem Fawaz", "Suman Banerjee" ]
    venue: "CHI '25: Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"
    year: 2025
    description: "We conducted user studies (N=21) and found that participants were unaware to both what the models output and when the models were used in Instagram and TikTok, two major social media platforms. In response to being exposed to the models’ functionality, we observed long term behavior changes in 8 participants. Our analysis uncovers the challenges and opportunities in providing transparency for machine learning models that interact with local user data."

    authors: [ "Jack West","Shirley Zhang",  "Kassem Fawaz", "Suman Banerjee" ]
    venue: "CHI '25 (Sociotechnical AI Governance: Opportunities and Challenges for HCI)"
    year: 2025
    description: "In this work, we compare the currently deployed models for both Instagram and TikTok to their public statements about internal AI governance practices to see if these models live up to their reported standards. We found that Instagram’s model may exhibit undesirable biases in concepts that their other internal models (eg, DINOv2) may lack. "

  - title: "Zipper: Latency-Tolerant Optimizations for High-Performance Buses"
    authors: ["Shibo Chen", "Shirley Zhang", "Todd Austin"]
    venue: "In Proceedings of the To Appear in The Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, Tokyo, Japan (pp. 20-23)."
    year: 2024
    description: "As heterogeneous designs take over the world of hardware designs, the data bus plays a vital role in interconnecting hosts and accelerators. While past works have emphasized increasing communication bandwidth for data-hungry workloads, this work focuses on optimizing latency for latency-sensitive acceleration applications."
